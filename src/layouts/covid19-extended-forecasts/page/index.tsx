          COVID19 will obviously have a substantial negative impact on economic activity in 2020. In response, .id has
          developed a COVID-19 Outlook Tool to show the economic and industry impacts at the LGA level. This tool draws
          on the economic forecast model developed by NIEIR and focuses on the impacts to September 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool should be viewed in conjunction with Unemployment and JobSeeker section to understand the impact of
          COVID-19 on the local labour force. To monitor the impact of COVID-19 on local businesses, see the Business
          Trends section.{' '}
